## How to run the Gourmet project:

- `npm install`
- `npm test`

Node version used: v13.12.0

## Issues

- if using Windows there might be an issue with the CRLF and LF line endings in the csv file.
For MacOS run `git config core.autocrlf true`

## Future improvements

- add highest and lowest scoring sentences
- apply the DRY principle
- beautify the json files output
